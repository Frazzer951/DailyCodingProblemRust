// NOT DONE

/* HARD
A rule looks like this:

A NE B

This means this means point A is located northeast of point B.

A SW C

means that point A is southwest of C.

Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate. For example:

A N B
B NE C
C N A


does not validate, since A cannot be both north and south of C.

A NW B
A N B


is considered valid.
