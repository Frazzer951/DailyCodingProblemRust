/* MEDIUM
You are given a histogram consisting of rectangles of different heights. These
heights are represented in an input list, such that [1, 3, 2, 5] corresponds to
the following diagram:

      x
      x
  x   x
  x x x
x x x x


Determine the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed only from the
bars of the histogram. For the diagram above, for example, this would be six,
representing the 2 x 3 area at the bottom right.
