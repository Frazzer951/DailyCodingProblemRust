// NOT DONE

/* MEDIUM
Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the
second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a
queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3].
If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.
