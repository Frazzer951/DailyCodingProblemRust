/* EASY
You are given given a list of rectangles represented by min and max x- and
y-coordinates. Compute whether or not a pair of rectangles overlap each other.
If one rectangle completely covers another, it is considered overlapping.

For example, given the following rectangles:

{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
},
{
    "top_left": (-1, 3),
    "dimensions": (2, 1)
},
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3)
}


return true as the first and third rectangle overlap each other.
