/* MEDIUM
Given a circular array, compute its maximum subarray sum in O(n) time. A
subarray can be empty, and in this case the sum is 0.

For example, given [8, -1, 3, 4], return 15 as we choose the numbers 3, 4, and 8
where the 8 is obtained from wrapping around.

Given [-4, 5, 1, 0], return 6 as we choose the numbers 5 and 1.
