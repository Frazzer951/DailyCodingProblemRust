/* EASY
Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an
integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5


You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).
