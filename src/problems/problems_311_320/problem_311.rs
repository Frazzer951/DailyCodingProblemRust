// NOT DONE

/* EASY
Given a array that's sorted but rotated at some unknown pivot, in which all
elements are distinct, find a "peak" element in O(log N) time.

An element is considered a peak if it is greater than both its left and right
neighbors. It is guaranteed that the first and last elements are lower than all
others.
