/* MEDIUM
An imminent hurricane threatens the coastal town of Codeville. If at most two
people can fit in a rescue boat, and the maximum weight limit for a given boat
is k, determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.

For example, given a population with weights [100, 200, 150, 80] and a boat
limit of 200, the smallest number of boats required will be three.
