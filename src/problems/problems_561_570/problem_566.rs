/* MEDIUM
A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can
be removed while still leaving the graph connected. For example, any binary tree
is minimally-connected.

Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can
choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
