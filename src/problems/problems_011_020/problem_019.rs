/* MEDIUM
A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different
colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring
houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to
build the nthhouse with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this
goal.
