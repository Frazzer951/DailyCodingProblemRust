/* HARD
Given a set of characters C and an integer k, a De Bruijn sequence is a cyclic
sequence in which every possible k-length string of characters in C occurs
exactly once.

For example, suppose C = {0, 1} and k = 3. Then our sequence should contain the
substrings {'000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111'}, and one
possible solution would be 00010111.

Create an algorithm that finds a De Bruijn sequence.
