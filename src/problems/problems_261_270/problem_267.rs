// NOT DONE

/* HARD
You are presented with an 8 by 8 matrix representing the positions of pieces on
a chess board. The only pieces on the board are the black king and various white
pieces. Given this matrix, determine whether the king is in check.

For details on how each piece moves, see here
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece#Moves_of_the_pieces].

For example, given the following matrix:

...K....
........
.B......
......P.
.......R
..N.....
........
.....Q..


You should return True, since the bishop is attacking the king diagonally.
