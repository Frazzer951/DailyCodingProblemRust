/* MEDIUM
Gray code [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code] is a binary code where each
successive value differ in only one bit, as well as when wrapping around. Gray
code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary spurious values during
transitions.

Given a number of bits n, generate a possible gray code for it.

For example, for n = 2, one gray code would be [00, 01, 11, 10].
