/* MEDIUM
The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term 1,
each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous
term. The first few terms are as follows:

1
11
21
1211
111221


As an example, the fourth term is 1211, since the third term consists of one 2
and one 1.

Given an integer N, print the Nth term of this sequence.
