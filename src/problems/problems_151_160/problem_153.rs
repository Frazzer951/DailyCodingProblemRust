/* HARD
Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of
words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat
hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat"
in between the two words.
