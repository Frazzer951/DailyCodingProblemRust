/* MEDIUM
The sequence [0, 1, ..., N] has been jumbled, and the only clue you have for its
order is an array representing whether each number is larger or smaller than the
last. Given this information, reconstruct an array that is consistent with it.
For example, given [None, +, +, -, +], you could return [1, 2, 3, 0, 4].
