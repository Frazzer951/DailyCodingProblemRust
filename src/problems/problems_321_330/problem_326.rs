/* HARD
A Cartesian tree with sequence S is a binary tree defined by the following two
properties:

 * It is heap-ordered, so that each parent value is strictly less than that of
   its children.
 * An in-order traversal of the tree produces nodes with values that correspond
   exactly to S.

For example, given the sequence [3, 2, 6, 1, 9], the resulting Cartesian tree
would be:

      1
    /   \
  2       9
 / \
3   6


Given a sequence S, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.
