/* MEDIUM
In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on
game results.

A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at
the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the
winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win
is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a
2000-ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player.

Implement this system.
