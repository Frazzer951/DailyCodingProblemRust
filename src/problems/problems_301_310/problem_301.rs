// NOT DONE

/* MEDIUM
Implement a data structure which carries out the following operations without
resizing the underlying array:

 * add(value): Add a value to the set of values.
 * check(value): Check whether a value is in the set.

The check method may return occasional false positives (in other words,
incorrectly identifying an element as part of the set), but should always
correctly identify a true element.
