/* MEDIUM
Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level
of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram 4
and 6 are cousins.

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6


Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.
