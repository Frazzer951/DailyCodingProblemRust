// NOT DONE

/* HARD
Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.

That is, given a string of length N and a pattern of length k, write a program
that searches for the pattern in the string with less than O(N * k) worst-case
time complexity.

If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return
False.
