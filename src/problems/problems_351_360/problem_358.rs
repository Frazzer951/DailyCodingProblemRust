Create a data structure that performs all the following operations in O(1) time:

 * plus: Add a key with value 1. If the key already exists, increment its value
   by one.
 * minus: Decrement the value of a key. If the key's value is currently 1,
   remove it.
 * get_max: Return a key with the highest value.
 * get_min: Return a key with the lowest value.
