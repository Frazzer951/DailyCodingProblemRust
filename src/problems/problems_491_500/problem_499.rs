// NOT DONE

/* EASY
A typical American-style crossword puzzle grid is an N x N matrix with black and
white squares, which obeys the following rules:

 * Every white square must be part of an "across" word and a "down" word.
 * No word can be fewer than three letters long.
 * Every white square must be reachable from every other white square.
 * The grid is rotationally symmetric (for example, the colors of the top left
   and bottom right squares must match).

Write a program to determine whether a given matrix qualifies as a crossword
grid.
