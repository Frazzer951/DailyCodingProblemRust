// NOT DONE

/* MEDIUM
You are given a list of jobs to be done, where each job is represented by a
start time and end time. Two jobs are compatible if they don't overlap. Find the
largest subset of compatible jobs.

For example, given the following jobs (there is no guarantee that jobs will be
sorted):

[(0, 6),
(1, 4),
(3, 5),
(3, 8),
(4, 7),
(5, 9),
(6, 10),
(8, 11)]


Return:

[(1, 4),
(4, 7),
(8, 11)]
