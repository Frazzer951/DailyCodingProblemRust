We have some historical clickstream data gathered from our site anonymously
using cookies. The histories contain URLs that users have visited in
chronological order.

Write a function that takes two users' browsing histories as input and returns
the longest contiguous sequence of URLs that appear in both.

For example, given the following two users' histories:

user1 = ['/home', '/register', '/login', '/user', '/one', '/two']
user2 = ['/home', '/red', '/login', '/user', '/one', '/pink']


You should return the following:

['/login', '/user', '/one']
